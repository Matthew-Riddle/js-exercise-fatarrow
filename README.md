  2. sub - a function that takes 2 parameters, a and b, and returns their difference.  
  3. mul - a function that takes 2 parameters, a and b, and returns their product.  
  4. div - a function that takes 2 parameters, a and b, and returns their dividend.  
  5. per - a function that takes 1 parameter, a, and returns a decimal representing its percentage out of 100.
