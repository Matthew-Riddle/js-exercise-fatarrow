# Fat-arrow Exercise

---

The goal of this exercise is to have students practice writing fat arrow functions in order to help them become more comfortable with the new syntax.

## Goal

---

To implement 5 functions using fat arrow notation:

1. add - a function that takes 2 parameters, a and b, and returns their sum.
2. sub - a function that takes 2 parameters, a and b, and returns their difference.
3. mul - a function that takes 2 parameters, a and b, and returns their product.
4. div - a function that takes 2 parameters, a and b, and returns their dividend.
5. per - a function that takes 1 parameter, a, and returns a decimal representing its percentage out of 100.

## Tasks

---

When the student has implement the 5 functions, they should run ```npm install``` to install the package dependencies. Once installed, they should run ```npm test``` to run their application against the given test cases.

- [ ] pass add test cases
- [ ] pass sub test cases
- [ ] pass mul test cases
- [ ] pass div test cases
- [ ] pass per test cases
